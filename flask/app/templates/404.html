<h1>WTF?</h1>
<p>Dude. What are you doing here? You think this a joke? You thought you can just throw errors at this website
    and it will crash? You have seen nothing. This bad boy rocks highly efficient html marks, written on high performance
    python that won't simply crumble under easy workloads. Now go back to index and stop complaining. Also, get bamboozled.</p>
